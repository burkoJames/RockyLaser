# The .stl files provide a total of 12 pieces, all of which are needed to construct the Laser.  If you download the .scad file you can create the pieces to your own liking using the existing code as a guide.  For instance, printing the tines and/or curves in individual pieces.  No warranty or support will be guarenteed if you choose to make these changes.
