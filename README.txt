# RockyLaser

If you download the .scad file you can create the pieces to your own liking using the existing code as a guide.
For instance, printing the tines and/or curves in individual pieces.
No warranty will be given nor will support be guarenteed if you choose to make these changes.

To Print the Laser using the provided .stl files, you need to print: 

1x RockyLaserPinnedLeftBody.stl
1x RockyLaserPinnedRightBody.stl
1x RockyLaserPinnedCurves.stl
3x RockyLaserPinnedTine.stl
1x RockyLaserPins.stl (this produces 17 pins, of which you are intended to use 15)

Please note that some 3d printers have problems printing the Pinned Tine Correctly.  I expect commercial-grade printers to
not have this problem.  But a home or hobbiest printer might fail when attempting to produce a good tine.  It 
tends to foul up printing the second half.  To correct this, you can delete one half of the pair, and print each half 
independently.
